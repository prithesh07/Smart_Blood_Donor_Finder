1. Firstly, when in emergency, all we would have to do is just to type our blood type and
everything else will be taken care by this one code.
2. We find the location of the user from where this code was ran using their ip address.
3. Later, we send this location to any blood donor website and can find the registered donors’
numbers from that site using selenium tool.
4. Now, we send a dummy message to everyone to find their ip addresses.
5. As soon as ip addresses of users are found, we filter only the users’ who are in same location
as us.
6. After this step, we now know the users and their numbers in the same location as us
7. Later, we send a mass message to all the available registered donors asking for help to donate
blood to us when we are in need. This is done using twilio.
8. We have done a smart work here to know blood donors and geo-tag them to our location and send texts to only people nearby.
