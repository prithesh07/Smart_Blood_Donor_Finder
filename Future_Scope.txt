We can create a real-time app that can later get approved from playstore with which we can
maintain a database to update with peopleâ€™s real-time locations everytime they open the app through sensors. This saves us the extra dummy message which we sent to everyone to obtain their ip
addresses and in the backend, it gets updated smartly with the last location of the user and date and
time. This lets us save dummy message and sends messages even more faster when maintained an app
for the same purpose. Hospitals and blood banks could use this to save their time and alert available
donors quickly in case of emergencies through these kind of bots by saving pressure on humans
during emergencies and also works quicker than us and much efficiently.
