“Tedious repetition is always a good argument for automation” .We introduce our Smart Blood Donor Finder. A simple action of pressing a button which gets the geo- location of the user who is in need of the blood as well as the geo-location of the members of blood bank who have registered, geo-tagging those within a particular range to find out who is available, nearby and medically eligible to donate at that moment. This way, we will be able to find at least one donor at a much faster rate among all by reducing manual workload of calling all possible donors one by one at the time of crisis.
